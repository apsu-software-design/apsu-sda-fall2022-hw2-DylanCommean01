# The Gathering Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "Gatherings" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I used the nouns to determine the various components: Organization, Organizations, Member, Members, Gathering, Gatherings and the user stories to generate the functions that each component would need aside from getters and setters. I did not have a manager component that would manage all of the other components. This manager had me rethink the methods that would be inside of each component. That way they could integrate well with the manager.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I did receive help from Dr. Church. He was instrumental in helping me get this done. I did look up a few W3 school articles on the filter function to remember how to effectly use that Array function.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> The assignment took me about 14-ish hours to complete.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> I would rate this assignment a 7. The assignment was not too difficult for me since I had experience with JavaScript at my job. I rated this a little higher though. I believe that most students will not have the experience that I have. If I didn't have that experience, there is a ton of writing and figuring out the structure of JavaScript and TypeScript. It is a terrific tutorial though and quite fun trying to figure out how to connect all the components to the manager.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> It was a little heavy on being open ended; however, I believe this is a good thing that students should experience. Having the UML diagram the professor designed occumpany the assignment would help. I do like the idea of having the students use their own UML's to try and solve it.
